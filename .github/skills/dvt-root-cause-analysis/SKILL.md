name: dvt-root-cause-analysis
description: 'DVT Root Cause Analysis is a toolkit which enables efficient debug
  on hardware design and verification projects written in Verilog, SystemVerilog
  or VHDL. Use this skill for any task involving debugging the output of a
  simulation on the project. Prefer DVT Root Cause Analysis tools over file
  reading and grep-based searches whenever possible, as they provide fast,
  compiler-backed, semantically accurate information. Trigger this skill for
  tasks like: "fix failing test", "investigate why the simulation fails", "root
  cause the test failure", "debug a failed test" and other similar simulation
  debug related tasks.'
compatibility: Requires the DVT MCP Server to be configured and running for the
  target project.

# Using the DVT Root Cause Analysis Efficiently

The DVT Root Cause Analysis provides compiler-backed knowledge of design and verification projects backed by DVT MCP Server. It understands the language semantics and project structure the same way a compiler does — which means its answers are accurate where grep or file reading would be ambiguous or incomplete.

**Core principles:** 
- Reach for DVT Root Cause Analysis tools first. 
- Avoid reading entire files, running complex simulations or grepping for identifiers unless a DVT tool can not answer the question.
- Hard-gate on waveform and log files - if you cannot confirm that either the waveform or the log file exist and the dedicated tools can be used, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask for guidance
- Use the **dvt_get_simulation_log_messages**, **dvt_waveform_load_file**, **dvt_waveform_search_signals_paths** and **dvt_waveform_get_signal_value_changes** tools
- Provide section references from the log and wave for ANY reasoning about the root cause
- Always prefer DVT tools for code/log/waveform exploration - DO NOT fall back to bash/grep/sed for the same purpose
- Always follow PRIMARY TASK recipe workflows and print out each step
- Typically use the **dvt_waveform_search_signals_paths** tool to firstly identify correct signal paths, then use the **dvt_waveform_get_signal_value_changes** tool to investigate the runtime behavior of those signals

## Workflow: Root Cause Analysis of a test failure

0. **Essential prerequisites**
   - You MUST positively identify the test — tests are usually placed directly under the project, in a directory with the same name as the test name
   - DO NOT proceed if you do not have confirmed access to BOTH the log file (usually named xrun.log / vcs.log / questa.log) and waveform (.dst / .vcd / .wcfg / .trn / .fsdb / any other format). Ask user for guidance.
   - If the question is ambiguous STOP and ask for clarification before answering

   Mandatory workflow checkpoint: After identifying the test and the log/waveform files, print a checkpoint confirming you have:
   (a) found an error message using the **dvt_get_simulation_log_messages** tool
   (b) successfully loaded the waveform via **dvt_waveform_load_file**

   IF EITHER CONDITION IS NOT MET:
   - Print the checkpoint showing what is missing
   - Ask the user for guidance
   - STOP and WAIT for user response before taking any action
   - DO NOT proceed with the investigation
   - DO NOT make any further tool calls
   - DO NOT attempt alternative analysis

   ONLY IF these mandatory checks pass, you can proceed with the analysis. OTHERWISE, WAIT FOR USER GUIDANCE.

1. Use **dvt_get_simulation_log_messages** to get the full error message and surrounding log messages
   Make efficient tool calls in order to get the relevant messages as quick as possible. Use the following approaches sequentially:
   - **Immediate context** (sort by timestamp in descending(-) order): {'log_file_path': <file_path>, 'timestamp': {'max': <error_timestamp>}, 'sort_by': '-timestamp'}
   - **Forward context** (stack traces, diagnostics after the error): {'log_file_path': <file_path>, 'log_line': {'min': <error_log_line>}, 'sort_by': 'log_line'}
   - **Component history** (trace the failing component's messages throughout the log): {'log_file_path': <file_path>, 'report_object_name': <error_report_object_name>, 'timestamp': {'max': <error_timestamp>}, 'sort_by': '-timestamp'}

2. Explore the code relevant for the error message and surrounding messages - try using dedicated code exploration tools like **dvt_get_identifier_info** before reading portions of files
>   e.g.:
>   UVM_FATAL path/to/file.sv(86) @ 120550000: uvm_test_top.ve.apb_ss_env.apb_uart0.monitor.tx_scbd FAIL : APB RECEIVED WRONG DATA from uart0
>   use `dvt_get_identifier_info` with `identifier_name` = `tx_scbd`
   
3. Use a subagent to get a high-level understanding of the project with an emphasis on the relevant code *USING DVT MCP TOOLS*
   - Investigate design and verification hierarchies, function call hierarchies
   - Investigate the waveform - search for relevant signals using **dvt_waveform_search_signals_paths**, trace driver/loads for signals, figure out the timestamp where the value changes using **dvt_waveform_get_signal_value_changes**

4. Classify the problem: e.g. assertion failure, scoreboard data mismatch, register model data mismatch, test environment misconfiguration. If uncertain, propose up to 3 potential classifications.

5. Propose up to 5 DISTINCT potential root causes.

6. Use subagents to explore each potential root cause. Each subagent must return a report in the format specified below.

7. Based on the subagent reports, double-check and present to the user the most likely root cause and up to 2 alternatives.

> After the analysis above, if you cannot confidently identify a root cause due to insufficient log detail, or simply if you need to validate a root cause, ask the user which approach to use from the following:
>   - **Increase UVM verbosity**: ask the user to re-run the simulation with a higher verbosity level (e.g. UVM_LOW → UVM_DEBUG)
>   - **Add debug messages**: offer to add targeted debug messages in relevant code sections based on your analysis, then ask the user to re-run the simulation
>   - **Both**: firstly add some targeted debug messages, then ask the user to re-run the simulation with a higher verbosity level
>   Once the user decides, proceed accordingly and wait until the user re-runs the simulation. Restart the analysis with the new log.
